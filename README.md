# Analysing and Visualizing Data
Analysing and Visualizing Data course project 
# E-commerce Sales Analysis and Data Visualization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the application of data cleaning and visualization techniques to an **Amazon sales dataset** to uncover insights that can help e-commerce businesses improve their pricing strategies, product offerings, and customer experience. The goal is to explore how **big data** can be used to understand product trends, customer behavior, and sales performance in the context of e-commerce.

### Key Objectives:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to remove inconsistencies and missing data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to discover trends and patterns.
- Visualize the data to provide actionable insights for businesses in the e-commerce sector.
- Apply the knowledge of data visualization, statistical methods, and machine learning techniques learned during the course.
